## Project Overview

AI Generated Posters is an innovative web application designed to bring custom poster designs to life using cutting-edge AI technology. Users can simply type in a prompt describing their desired poster, and our AI, powered by Stable Diffusion, generates a unique poster based on that input. The project is currently in the prototyping stage and aims to expand into a comprehensive service including poster creation, a payment system, and more.

### Minimum Viable Product (MVP)

The MVP of AI Generated Posters focuses on delivering three key functionalities:

1. **AI Image Generation:** Utilizes AI algorithms to generate artistic images based on user prompts.
2. **Poster Creation and Supply:** Plans to offer a feature where users can have their custom poster designs printed in frames.
3. **Payment System:** Implementation of a secure payment system for transactions related to poster purchases.

### Prototype

The current prototype includes the following features:

- **Text Box for Prompt Entry:** Users can enter a descriptive prompt for their desired poster design.
- **AI-Generated Image:** Based on the user's prompt, the AI generates a custom image.
- **Image Framing:** The generated image is then superimposed onto a stock image of a frame.
- **Image Display to User:** Users can view the final framed poster image, giving them a clear idea of the end product.

### AI Image Generation Options

- **Stable Diffusion:** The prototype currently employs Stable Diffusion for image generation, renowned for its ability to create detailed and coherent images based on textual descriptions.

## Development Status

The project is in its early stages, focusing on prototyping and testing core functionalities. Future developments will include integrating additional features like the poster creation service and a robust payment system.

### Contributions and Feedback

As we are in the prototyping phase, we welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback to enhance the application. Whether it's feature enhancements, UI/UX improvements, or code optimizations, your input is valuable to us.
